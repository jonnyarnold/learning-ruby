# Learning Ruby

Can you teach programming to an 8-year-old? That's what the [Wizzie Wizzie Computer Club](http://www.wizziewizzie.org/) tries to do every Saturday!

They wanted a refresher of their existing Ruby course to extend it and go into more detail. This is my attempt to do that!

## How To Take This Course

Start at [Chapter 1](1-MyStory.md) and work through the chapters in order.

## Status

The aim is to have 8 projects: check out the [Syllabus](Syllabus.md) for a rough draft.

Currently these chapters have not been tested against the target age group. **If you want to use them, please do!** Any feedback would be welcome as a [Github Issue](https://github.com/jonnyarnold/learning-ruby/issues/new). Specifically, it would be good to know:

- What was easy? What was hard? (How much programming have they done before? Do the explanations make sense?)
- How long do the chapters take to do? (I'm hoping they take 1-2 hours to do.)
- Are there any typos or errors?
- Did you find yourself in a situation that you didn't understand? If so, what?
- How can I make it more fun?
